## Introduction

When designing an electrical system, one of the most common ways to get multiple devices communicating over a wired connection is to use I2C. This is a very common way for sensors to communicate with a main microcontroller/microprocessor. In this tutorial, you should be able to learn how to get devices communicating over I2C fairly easily.

### Learning Objectives

- Students should be able to learn how to wire two devices together to communicate over I2C.
- Students will learn the basics of I2C message structure and addresses.
- Students will be able to have two devices communicating useful information over I2C.
