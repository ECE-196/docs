## Introduction

This tutorial is to get you started on your ESP32 and Arduino coding journey. We will start with a speaker to have a more hands on approach to join the bridge between hardware and software. The user should be able to change their code and quickly see that change be outputted based on a different sound that the speaker will produce. This is a great starter project to ease the user into the course for all skill levels. This is a easy way for the user to get accustomed to using the Arduino IDE and components everyone has seen but may have never used. 
### Learning Objectives

- Getting started with Arduino IDE coding
- Learn how to make a sound with a speaker 

### Background Information

We will be introducing coding based on Arduino IDE and how to turn a speaker on as well as change its sound based on frequency. This is a great way to prototype before getting started on designing a PCB. The speaker and led was chosen as these are products everyone has seen or heard of before, but may have never had the chance to work on those parts themselves. 

Pro
- user controlled sound output
- connections to things used everyday

Con
- Could be difficult to scale up
- Components are fairly costly

Key concepts
- Basic Arduino code
- Setting up a circuit
- Output change based on user input 

## Getting Started

### Required Downloads and Installations

Download the required [arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) software, we will be doing the coding here

### Required Components

| Component Name | Quanitity |
| -------------- | --------- |
| ESP32          | 1         |
| BreadBoard     | 1         |
| Speaker        | 1         |
| jumper cables  | 6         |
| 220 ohm Resistor  | 1         |
### Required Tools and Equipment

- A laptop with Arduino IDE downloaded
- Depending on the speaker, soldering may be needed
- Usb cable for connections


## Part 01: Setting up the breadboard

### Introduction

We will start this project by placing all of the components needed onto the breadboard and hooking it up to the correct terminals on the ESP32. 

### Objective

- Learn how to set up connections from the breadboard to ESP32
- Learn how to correctly orient a component based on the manufacturer's datasheet 

### Background Information

Give a brief explanation of the technical skills learned/needed
in this challenge. There is no need to go into detail as a
separation document should be prepared to explain more in depth
about the technical skills

### Components

- List the components needed in this challenge

### Instructional

- We will start by soldering one side of the wires onto the speaker.

- Place wires from the ESP32 to the breadboard
  
- Connect the speaker to the ESP32 through the breadboard

- Next
