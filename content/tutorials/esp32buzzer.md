## Introduction

This tutorial is to get you started on your ESP32 and Arduino coding journey. We will start with a speaker to have a more hands on approach to join the bridge between hardware and software. The user should be able to change their code and quickly see that change be outputted based on a different sound that the speaker will produce. This is a great starter project to ease the user into the course for all skill levels. This is a easy way for the user to get accustomed to using the Arduino IDE and components everyone has seen but may have never used. 
### Learning Objectives

- Getting started with Arduino IDE coding
- Learn how to make a sound with a speaker 

### Background Information

Describe your topic here. What does it do? Why do you use it?
Are there other similar things to use? What are the pros and cons?
Explain important concepts that are necessary to understand.
Include (and cite if needed) any visuals that will help the audience understand.

## Getting Started

For any software prerequisites, write a simple excerpt on each
technology the participant will be expecting to download and install.
Aim to demystify the technologies being used and explain any design
decisions that were taken. Walk through the installation processes
in detail. Be aware of any operating system differences.
For hardware prerequisites, list all the necessary components that
the participant will receive. A table showing component names and
quantities should suffice. Link any reference sheets or guides that
the participant may need.
The following are stylistic examples of possible prerequisites,
customize these for each workshop.

We will be using Arduino IDE for the software side of things and a breadboard for all of the connections on the hardware side of things. 

### Required Downloads and Installations

Download the required [arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) software, we will be doing most of the work in here
### Required Components

List your required hardware components and the quantities here.

| Component Name | Quanitity |
| -------------- | --------- |
| ESP32          | 1         |
| BreadBoard     | 1         |
| Speaker        | 1         |
| jumper cables  | 6         |
| 220 ohm Resistor  | 1         |
### Required Tools and Equipment

List any tools and equipment you need here.
(Ex, computer, soldering station, etc.)

- A laptop with Arduino IDE downloaded
- Depending on the speaker, soldering may be needed
- Usb cable for connections
- Jumper cables  
## Part 01: Setting up the breadboard

### Introduction

We will start this project by placing all of the components needed onto the breadboard and hooking it up to the correct terminals on the ESP32. 

### Objective

- Learn how to set up connections from the breadboard to ESP32
- Learn how to read a datasheet

### Background Information

Give a brief explanation of the technical skills learned/needed
in this challenge. There is no need to go into detail as a
separation document should be prepared to explain more in depth
about the technical skills

### Components

- List the components needed in this challenge

### Instructional

- We will start by soldering one side of the wires onto the speaker.

- Place wires from the ESP32 to the breadboard
  
- Connect the speaker to the ESP32 through the breadboard

- Next
