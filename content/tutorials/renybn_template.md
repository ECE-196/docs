## Introduction

# Creating a Simple AND gate using an ESP32 and Arduino IDE

For this tutorial, the goal is to create an **AND gate** incorporating an *ESP32* and *Arduino IDE*. The goal of this tutorial is for the user to get comfortable being able to work with both hardware and software and be able to integrate them together.

Motivation behind this tutorial : 

- The ESP32 is the "go-to" microcontroller that can be used for countless projects
 
- Arduino IDE is the programming language most commonly used to upload code to an ESP32, making your useless components come to life  

- There is a high probability that you will need to use an ESP32 and/or Arduino IDE for your final project in this class !

What you will gain from completing this tutorial : 

- Be able to create a real-life circuit from reading a schematic 

- Be able to get comfortable with the ESP32, especially when it comes to pinouts and being able to read a datasheet

- Become comfortable using Arduino IDE; being able to understand fundamental syntax and getting familiar on how to write some simple code

### Learning Objectives

A good engineer can be good at hardware or good at software. But a great engineer is able to understand both. That is what I hope you will be able to expand your skills on :

- Hardware skills

- Software skills 

- Integration

### Background Information

The goal of this project is to create an AND gate by combining both software and hardware aspects. On the breadbaord, you will have two buttons. When clicked simultanbeously, this will turn on an LED that is incorporated with the circuit on the breadboard. But if you only click one button at a time, nothing will happen. Though this project may sound simple, it is important that you understand how to incorporate multiple different pieces of technology together to create something, whether it is small or big. There may be other components that you can use but these components are good for now, since they are things we can get familiar with. The good thing and bad thing about this project is that we have to incorporate many different components and technology to create something. This may seem bad because it can be seen as overkill but can also be seen as good since we are incorporating a variety of components that are fundamental for engineers to know about.

## Getting Started

Software : As mentioned earlier, you will need to use Arduino IDE to complete this project. Below is a great video that will show you how to use Arduino IDE step-by-step. You will get an understanding on how to use the Arduino board (same logic applies to the ESP32), downloading Arduino IDE, and getting familiar with common functions and variables.

Hardware: For the hardware side of things, as mentioned earlier, you will receive a couple of components, which can be seen below in Required Components. All of these are very common items that you are familiar with.

### Required Downloads and Installations

To install Arduino IDE, please click the link down below and download the latest version of the operating system you are using (MacOS, Windows, or Linux) :

https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/

### Required Components

For this mini project, you will need a small list of hardware components which include:

- M-F Wires 5x 
- M-M Wires 2x 
- 10k ohm resistors 2x 
- 220 ohm resistor 1x 
- single-pole single-throw buttons 2x 
- 1x breadboard 
- esp32 1x 

### Required Tools and Equipment

Some tools and equipment that you will need:

- Computer

- Cable to connect computer to esp32

## Part 1: Circuit Design

### Introduction

In this part, you will be creating the AND circuit onto a breadboard by referencing a schematic

### Objective

- Get the reader to become comfortable creating a real-life circuit from viewing a schematic

### Background Information

Every engineer needs to know how to read a schematic and be able to replicate it into real-life. This is vital skill to learn, because schematics are the universal language of circuitry and in everything you will ever build. For this part, we will use a few fundamental components that you will guarantee use throughout your engineering journey.

### Components

The components that you will need for this section are :

- M-F Wires 5x 
- M-M Wires 2x 
- 10k ohm resistors 2x 
- 220 ohm resistor 1x 
- single-pole single-throw buttons 2x 
- 1x breadboard 
- ESP32

### Instructional

Teach the contents of this section

Create an AND gate using the components up above. Surpirsingly, there are a variety of ways you are able to set this up, don't be afraid to get creative. If you are having trouble trying to figure things out, try drawing a schematic or use the example down below as a reference.

## Example

### Introduction

Below is the schematic that you will be creating your circuit from

### Example

Here is a real-life example of the how the circuit should look like.

### Analysis

Explain how the example used your tutorial topic. Give in-depth analysis of each part and show your understanding of the tutorial topic

This example used the tutorial topic by utilizing a schematic to create our circuit, which we have stated multiple times throughout the tutorial. From the getco, I was able to provide the reader with all of the components and resources that were required for this project. I was able to describe in great detail what the objective of this project was going to be and also explained as to why this proejct was important to learn. I provided beginner friendly resources for the reader to use to get familiar with Arduino IDE. I provided all necesary components that was required for part 1 and also provided schematics and real-life examples of how the circuit should look like. I do believe that I provided more than enough information for the user to be able to understand what is going and how to proceed with minimal hesistation.
