## Introduction

This tutorial walks you through turning an ESP32 DevKit into a tiny Wi‑Fi “light mixer.” By the end, you’ll serve a webpage with three sliders that change the Red, Green, and Blue channels of an RGB LED in real‑time. The project shows how easy it is to combine embedded PWM control with HTTP requests so that any phone or laptop becomes a wireless color picker.

### Learning Objectives

- Spin up a minimalist HTTP server on the ESP32 (using the built‑in WiFi.h and WebServer.h libraries or ESPAsyncWebServer).

- Parse slider/GET parameters from a browser and map them to values (0‑255).

- Generate Pulse‑Width‑Modulation (PWM) signals on three GPIO pins.

- Wire and current‑limit a common‑cathode RGB LED.

- Test and debug over Serial and the browser console.

### Background Information

Describe your topic here. What does it do? Why do you use it?
Are there other similar things to use? What are the pros and cons?
Explain important concepts that are necessary to understand.
Include (and cite if needed) any visuals that will help the audience understand.

## Getting Started

For any software prerequisites, write a simple excerpt on each
technology the participant will be expecting to download and install.
Aim to demystify the technologies being used and explain any design
decisions that were taken. Walk through the installation processes
in detail. Be aware of any operating system differences.
For hardware prerequisites, list all the necessary components that
the participant will receive. A table showing component names and
quantities should suffice. Link any reference sheets or guides that
the participant may need.
The following are stylistic examples of possible prerequisites,
customize these for each workshop.

### Required Downloads and Installations

List any required downloads and installations here.
Make sure to include tutorials on how to install them.
You can either make your own tutorials or include a link to them.
