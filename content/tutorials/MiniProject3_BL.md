## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to set up the ESP32 to control a vibration motor. A vibration motor is one of many acutators that you can use to give tactile input to the user.
By the end you should be able to precisely control the intensity and timing of a vibration motor to fulfill your desired purpose.

### Learning Objectives

- Controlling ESP32 in Python and Arduino
- Making a GUI in Python to control a vibration motor

### Background Information

A vibration motor is one of the simplest and easiest ways to give applications a way to provide haptic feedback to the user. It is used in many devices that are handheld or worn of the body. One of the most common uses would be the vibration motor in a smartphone to notify the user of an incoming call or update. Vibration motors are advantageous over audio feedback in loud environments, but require the user to be in close contact as a downside.

Pros
- Intuitive, fast feedback
- Reliable and easy to use

Cons
- User has to touch the device to receive feedback
- Limited communication

## Getting Started

For software we will be using Python in VSCode and Arduino. Make sure to install the latest versions on your corressponding operating system. 

### Required Downloads and Installations

  [Python in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)

  [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)
  
### Required Components

| Component Name  | Quanitity |
| --------------- | --------- |
| ESP32           | 1         |
| Vibration Motor | 1         |

Make sure the vibration motor operates in a range from 3V to 5V.

### Required Tools and Equipment

- Computer capable of running VSCode and Arduino
- USB-C data transferring cable
- Soldering station
- Wires or jumper cables
