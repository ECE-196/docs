## Introduction

This tutorial will teach readers how to use the MPU 6000 to measure the x y and z axises to keep upright

### Learning Objectives

- MPU schematics and ways to utilize the chip
- Schematic making, as well as using KiCad to 3d render

### Background Information

The MPU chip is primarily used in drones to keep their orientation stable, in your phones, or even in your controllers if you play on it. So, specifically we are trying to do it for drone purposes. We would first need to create the board creating a schematic, then further it by connecting that to a microcontroller that receives the data.

What we're aiming for
1. Making sure that our wiring can power the device on.
2. Provides real-time feedback on where exactly the device is orientated.


Key Concepts:

1. Circuit Basics
2. KiCad Basics

## Getting Started

For any software prerequisites, write a simple excerpt on each
technology the participant will be expecting to download and install.
Aim to demystify the technologies being used and explain any design
decisions that were taken. Walk through the installation processes
in detail. Be aware of any operating system differences.
For hardware prerequisites, list all the necessary components that
the participant will receive. A table showing component names and
quantities should suffice. Link any reference sheets or guides that
the participant may need.
The following are stylistic examples of possible prerequisites,
customize these for each workshop.

### Required Downloads and Installations

List any required downloads and installations here.
Make sure to include tutorials on how to install them.
You can either make your own tutorials or include a link to them.
