## Introduction

This tutorial walks through building a simple **Wi-Fi scanner** using a **ESP32 Dev Board** you have created and a USB-C cable. It will then display them in both the Arduino Serial Monitor and on a simple web server, which this tutorial will walk you through. The project scans for nearby Wi-Fi networks and displays their names and signal strengths through the Serial Monitor. By the end, youâ€™ll know how to set up your board, write and upload code, and understand how Wi-Fi scanning works on the ESP32!

### Learning Objectives

- Understand how the ESP32 performs Wi-Fi network scans
- Set up Arduino IDE and connect your ESP32
- Learn how to use the Serial Monitor to display data as well as on a web server
- Explore `WiFi.h` library functions and network properties to scan for Wi-Fi networks
- Understand 2.4 GHz vs. 5 GHz Wi-Fi limitations
- Make your ESP32 create its own Wi-Fi for demonstration

Any additional notes from the developers can be included here.

### Background Information

Describe your topic here. What does it do? Why do you use it?
Are there other similar things to use? What are the pros and cons?
Explain important concepts that are necessary to understand.
Include (and cite if needed) any visuals that will help the audience understand.

## Getting Started

For any software prerequisites, write a simple excerpt on each
technology the participant will be expecting to download and install.
Aim to demystify the technologies being used and explain any design
decisions that were taken. Walk through the installation processes
in detail. Be aware of any operating system differences.
For hardware prerequisites, list all the necessary components that
the participant will receive. A table showing component names and
quantities should suffice. Link any reference sheets or guides that
the participant may need.
The following are stylistic examples of possible prerequisites,
customize these for each workshop.

### Required Downloads and Installations

List any required downloads and installations here.
Make sure to include tutorials on how to install them.
You can either make your own tutorials or include a link to them.
