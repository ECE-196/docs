## Introduction

In the mini project, I will be making an obstacle detecting system using an IR obstacle avoidance senor, LED, and Resistor. From this students will be able to learn how to use the Arduino IDE software and write code so that the ESP tells the sensor an obstacle is near. Most people would use a Proximity Sensor to detect an obstacle, this is an alternative!


### Learning Objectives

- Be able to write basic code in Arduino IDE
- Learn ho to use pinouts of ESP32-Mini
- How you can further add to this project

### Background Information

Describe your topic here. What does it do? Why do you use it?
Are there other similar things to use? What are the pros and cons?
Explain important concepts that are necessary to understand.
Include (and cite if needed) any visuals that will help the audience understand.

- An IR Obstacle Detector, RED LED, and Resistor will be used together to act as a car parking sensor
- We use the IR Obstacle Detector to use give back a binary value (if a obstacle is present or if its clear)
- In total, there ill be to LED's used, one on the IR Obstacle Detector (green) and one on a seperate breadboard (red). These will be used to to visually represent if a car is present or not.



## Getting Started

For any software prerequisites, write a simple excerpt on each
technology the participant will be expecting to download and install.
Aim to demystify the technologies being used and explain any design
decisions that were taken. Walk through the installation processes
in detail. Be aware of any operating system differences.
For hardware prerequisites, list all the necessary components that
the participant will receive. A table showing component names and
quantities should suffice. Link any reference sheets or guides that
the participant may need.
The following are stylistic examples of possible prerequisites,
customize these for each workshop.

### Required Downloads and Installations

List any required downloads and installations here.
Make sure to include tutorials on how to install them.
You can either make your own tutorials or include a link to them.

### Required Components

List your required hardware components and the quantities here.

| Component Name | Quanitity |
| -------------- | --------- |
|       IR obstacle avoidance sensor         |       1    |
|                |           |

### Required Tools and Equipment

List any tools and equipment you need here.
(Ex, computer, soldering station, etc.)

## Part 01: Name

### Introduction

Briefly introduce what  you are teaching in this section.

### Objective
