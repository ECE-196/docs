## Introduction

This mini tutorial shows how to set up a simple BLE server using an ESP32-S3 Mini and let it communicate with other devices.

### Learning Objectives

- get familiar with the ESP-32
- experience with Arduino
- setup BLE connection from ESP-32 to other devices
- testing and troubleshooting it

## Setup Hardware
- ESP-32 connected with USB-C to your Laptop

## Setup Software
- Arduino installed

## Example Code (I will add the full code step by step with explanations too)

```cpp
#include <BLEDevice.h>

```
## Testing
- connect to BLE app

## Common errors
