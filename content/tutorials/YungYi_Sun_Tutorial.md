## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to use an ESP32 with an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance. It’s a simple project to help you get started with sensors and microcontrollers and how to interface them with code. You’ll learn how to connect the parts, write the code, and read real-time distance data on your computer.

### Learning Objectives

- Bullet list of skills/concepts to be covered

Any additional notes from the developers can be included here.

### Background Information

Describe your topic here. What does it do? Why do you use it?
Are there other similar things to use? What are the pros and cons?
Explain important concepts that are necessary to understand.
Include (and cite if needed) any visuals that will help the audience understand.

## Getting Started

For any software prerequisites, write a simple excerpt on each
technology the participant will be expecting to download and install.
Aim to demystify the technologies being used and explain any design
decisions that were taken. Walk through the installation processes
in detail. Be aware of any operating system differences.
For hardware prerequisites, list all the necessary components that
the participant will receive. A table showing component names and
quantities should suffice. Link any reference sheets or guides that
the participant may need.
The following are stylistic examples of possible prerequisites,
customize these for each workshop.

### Required Downloads and Installations

List any required downloads and installations here.
Make sure to include tutorials on how to install them.
You can either make your own tutorials or include a link to them.

### Required Components

List your required hardware components and the quantities here.

| Component Name | Quanitity |
| -------------- | --------- |
| ESP32               |  1         |
