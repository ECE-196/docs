## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to set up the ESP32 to control a vibration motor. A vibration motor is one of many acutators that you can use to give tactile input to the user.
By the end you should be able to precisely control the intensity and timing of a vibration motor to fulfill your desired purpose.

### Learning Objectives

- Controlling ESP32 in Python and Arduino
- Making a GUI in Python to control a vibration motor

### Background Information

Describe your topic here. What does it do? Why do you use it?
Are there other similar things to use? What are the pros and cons?
Explain important concepts that are necessary to understand.
Include (and cite if needed) any visuals that will help the audience understand.

## Getting Started

For any software prerequisites, write a simple excerpt on each
technology the participant will be expecting to download and install.
Aim to demystify the technologies being used and explain any design
decisions that were taken. Walk through the installation processes
in detail. Be aware of any operating system differences.
For hardware prerequisites, list all the necessary components that
the participant will receive. A table showing component names and
quantities should suffice. Link any reference sheets or guides that
the participant may need.
The following are stylistic examples of possible prerequisites,
customize these for each workshop.

### Required Downloads and Installations

  [Python in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)

  [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)
