Usually PCB's are nicely packaged in some thoughtful form of an enclosure.

For the VU meter, you will need to design and manufacture your own thoughtful enclosure.

## Design

{{% steps %}}

### Sketch by Hand

Make a sketch of your PCB and enclosure

- Use either a paper and pencil or some drawing tool on a laptop or Ipad-like device
- Measure your PCB using a ruler and/or caliper, and mark the measurements on your sketch
- Sketch, even roughly, your enclosure idea and mark some of the primary measurements (these can change later)

### CAD - Computer Aided Design

Translate your sketch to a CAD file

- You may use any CAD software, but we highly recommend the use of [Onshape](https://onshape.com), [SolidWorks](https://solidWorks.com), or [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/).
- When creating your CAD file, consider how to improve 3D printability and consider tolerance

### Save Files and Submit

- Save your CAD file(s) as either .sldprt, .iges, or .step files.
- Take Screen Shots (or export improved renderings) of your CAD
- Submit onto Github

We will discuss these in class, and after we complete PCB Assembly we will 3D print these CAD Files!

## Fabrication

Before moving on to 3D printing, be sure to review your enclosure design with your instructors and peers.

### Review your CAD File / Design

Consider both the Assembled VU meter dimensions and 3D printability

- Consider your dimensions, and leave some room (i.e., tolerance) so that your VU meter could fit nicely.
- Consider what you may need to access, for example, USB connector, small switch, or LEDs.
- Consider the time your 3D print will take to finish. If too long, consider breaking into multiple smaller prints.

### Complete EnVision Training

EnVision 3D printing trainings are found within the student portal at [Envision's Website] (envision.ucsd.edu).

- Remember that there are instructor assistants and envision staff (orange vests) there to help you if you are unsure about printing
- Remember also that you get $5 (i.e., 5 hours of printing) for joining envision, but ECE 196 provides another $5 for printing during the class (request more if needed)

### Build a 3D print File

- Save your CAD file as an .STL and transfer to the computers near the 3D printers with a USB drive
- Double check your selections for resolution and support. We recommend the lowest resolution (for fastest times) whenever prototyping although the tolerance may be slightly worse. This will help tremendously when iterating multiple times.
- Submit onto Github

#### Check out your print and iterate if need

- Please bring in your assembled VU meter including the enclosure in a future class.
