## Step-by-step

{{% steps %}}

### Components

First, grab the components you need from the component table.

You need:

- 11 LEDs (with colors of your choice)
- 11 560-1k resistors (to select brightness of your choice)
- Pin headers
- 1 Microphone and accompanying module

### Soldering

Then, go to EnVision to solder the components with the available equipment of your choice (probably a soldering iron).

Soldering these SMD components by hand can take some finesse, so feel free take your time.
In the next assignment we will learn a method for soldering boards with many SMD components.

## Things to Consider

- Which direction should the LEDs point?
- Which side should the pin headers and microphone be placed?
