## Step-by-step

{{% steps %}}

### Components

First, grab the components you need from the component table.

You need:

- Bare Lightshield PCB
- 11 LEDs of various colors
- 11 1k resistors

After you have successfully soldered the above, check in with an IA to get:


- Pin headers
- 1 Microphone and accompanying module

### Soldering

Then, go to EnVision to solder the components with the available equipment of your choice (probably a soldering iron).

Soldering these SMD components by hand can take some finesse, so feel free take your time.

In the next assignment we will learn a method for soldering boards with many SMD components.

## Things to Consider

- Which direction should the LEDs point?
- Which side should the pin headers and microphone be placed?
