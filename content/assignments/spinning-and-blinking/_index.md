In this assignment you will learn to create a **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface (GUI) to interact with a microcontroller.

**You are faced with an important decision.**

We will be leaving CircuitPython in the pursuit of better understanding how good -- production ready -- firmware is written.

For this assignment, you have **two** options for how to proceed:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="arduino" title="Arduino" image="images/arduino.png" >}}
  {{< card link="rust" title="Rust" image="images/ferris.png" subtitle="This little guy is named Ferris :)" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

You may already be familiar with Arduino, as it is a very popular educational platform for introducing students to embedded systems. If
you don't want these assignments to be any more challenging than they already are, or you aren't particularly passionate about/interested in
embedded systems, you should select this option.

You may have *heard* of Rust, or even tried it! Rust as an embedded systems language is a brand new field on the bleeding edge of industry.
As such, there are less resources, it is incomplete, and it is ever changing. If you want a challenge, to get a *much* better understanding of
how microcontrollers actually work, and a taste of the future, we recommend this option.
