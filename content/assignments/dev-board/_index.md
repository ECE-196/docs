For this assignment you will be assembling an **EnVision Mini DevBoard**.

This assignment is the next piece to making your own VUMeter. The DevBoard contains the microcontroller that will control the light shield.

The DevBoard is *not* as simple as the previous, and will require additional equipment. This time, you will use a **stencil** to apply **solder paste** _exactly_ on each pad.

Hope you don't have shaky hands!
