For this assignment you will create a tutorial for the next generation of ECE 196 students.

If you go to the ECE 196 website homepage, you'll see a "Tutorials" section.

This is where your tutorials will go!

To get started with your tutorial, get the template from [here](https://github.com/ece-196/tutorial).

You will need to **clone** *this* repository and make a **pull request** to push your changes to this site.

Learn about pull requests [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

The ECE 196 website uses **Markdown** for writing documents which are rendered as webpages.

Learn about markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org).

The ECE 196 website repository file tree looks like:

{{< filetree/container >}}
  {{< filetree/folder name="docs" >}}
    {{< filetree/folder name="content" >}}
      {{< filetree/folder name="additional-resources" state="closed" >}}
      {{< /filetree/folder >}}
      {{< filetree/folder name="assignments" state="closed" >}}
      {{< /filetree/folder >}}
      {{< filetree/folder name="tutorials" >}}
        {{< filetree/file name="your_tutorial.md" >}}
        {{< filetree/file name="_index.md" >}}
      {{< /filetree/folder >}}
    {{< /filetree/folder >}}
  {{< /filetree/folder >}}
{{< /filetree/container >}}

Create your tutorial where you see `your_tutorial.md`.

If your pull request is good, we'll accept it, if not, we'll leave comments to help you.

Once it is accepted, you have finished this assignment.
